@user 1/3 of my generation is missing. And it can't be changed. But we can change the future.   #ProLifeYouth
@user Dehumanizing? Why are you dehumanizing the pregnant person? They're more than walking incubators, and have rights!
A #person's value is not determined by his #size. #prolifegen #prolifeyouth

When is abortion a responsible choice? When a woman chooses it to be
Any asshat "protesting" against #SofiaVergara is a disgrace to the entire Women's Rights movement. Live and let live.
I just want to sit in a corner and cry.  I wish I was a thicker-skinned feminist but this shit is personal! #MyBodyMyRights
@user Yes, your reasoning is horrible. We were talking about abortion, not death.
Mzwakhe mbuli says doctors & nurses are paid assassins.. they kill unborn babies & give it a fancy name
How ironic is it that im sitting in @user & swiping on @user right now?
Whether someone wants to have children or not should be completely up to the person carrying that pregnancy...
@user @user @user Ginsburg already supports the death penalty..she calls it
A person's a person, no matter how small. - Dr. Suess #WAAR
In the aim for equality we have forgotten the most innocent, the smallest, the most precious among us. The unborn. #catholic
I was born 4 months premature... I'm perfectly fine, somehow killing babies is legal in this country.
@user Unjustified homicide should ALWAYS be illegal, including #ProlifeYouth
You have a #God given right to #live. And of all places, inside your #mother. -Phil Robertsonyouthgen
Thank you for another day of life Lord. #Christian #Catholic #TeamJesus

Thanks @user  Kudos to @user for caring about the safety of unborn children #auspol
@user And the unborn ARE human lives completely human & alive from conception. Abortion KILLS

@user @user Once they're born, that is.
Can we get a law for the little ones who can't even speak for themselves? #ProLifeYouth #EVERYLIFEMATTERS #gay #straight #baby
They say God isn't listening? Just look at that radar today. #prayfornepal
As good a time as any to say: when too many men are adjudicating on women's reproductive systems, the results are never good #Rape
There's an undeniable inverse correlation between women's right to choose and crime rates #womensrights
@user @user My wife had an abortion when she was young She regrets it to this day
If you're all about equality, then the unborn babies get an equal chance at life too....#EqualityForTheUnborn
Everyone who disagrees has always had the right to mind their own damn business!!!! #LoveWins
@user I know. God won't be mocked tho. So I blv we shd expect judgment~as if thr wr not already enuf rzn 2 judge America.
I get the whole "Kill your darlings" advice, but I feel like an abortionist with all these unfinished stories. #Writing  #Literary
If being a mother's womb isn't safe I guess neither are churches; specifically black ones #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches
Plenty of stem cells without baby smashing, by the way.
Why don't black lives matter in the womb?
Hey, #BristolPalin, when Alaska asked you to promote "wide open spaces," pretty sure they were talking about the state.
The same people that demand gov stay out of their vaginas, demand that gov legitimize their same sex bedrooms! Curious.  #LoveWins
Love Wins? No it didn't. Love won't truly win until there is an end to abortion. Unborn babies deserve love too.
If 'tis not human beings in the womb, how do we harvest and transplant their organs onto human beings?
#PeoplesDebate Better every child born out of marriage + every mothers get #loneparents allowance than there be a single #VinB
@user  yes he has an opinion but the choice should be in the hands of the women You know the person directly affected?
Before I formed you in the #womb I knew you. #prolifegen #prolifeyouth #God
@user ...about the millions of aborted children? Lets fix this too #LoveWins
@user What could have happened in her past to make her the cruel & frighteningly hard-hearted woman she is? #waronwomen
@user the premeditated taking of an innocent human life is 1st degree murder, and you know it.
Every time you respond to something that frustrates you, you let it steal away your time and happiness. #EasyWeightLoss
Obamcare loses again in the Supreme Court. Religious freedom win. #scotus #tcot
It hurts my  2 C ppl more offended over a flag/symbol than deaths/abortions of millions of innocent children! #flag #Mississippi
The HHS contraceptive mandate has been challenged in #SCOUTS 6 times and has lost 6 times.      #contraception
Still waiting for Libs to explain how the premeditated murder of a premature baby is reproductive healthcare. #ccot
It's time to be a #voice for the #voiceless. Stand up for the #unborn! #AllLivesMatter #ProLifeYouth #chooselife
BRAVO TO BOTH OF YOU BEAUTIFULLY EXPLAINED HOLD UP #humantrafficking bill @user @user #womensrights #righttochoose
@user - I guess this means you're happy for me to be pro-life as I never aborted any of my own children? #hypocrisy
My body, my life. You fuck it up in a way I'm not prepared for and I will kill you.
Thank you @user for treating me with kindness & respect & TLC during my wellness exam. #womenshealth #yaycondoms
